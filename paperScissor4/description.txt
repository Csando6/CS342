paperScissor4 is a java based project

In this project, we were assigned to create the game "rock, paper, scissor, spcock, and Lizzard".
The main criteria for this project was to:
>implement the game with a socket server, the server would drive the game, the clients would join
>implement multithreading: with the server running on the main thread, we needed seperate threads for the GUI
>implement GUI: For the clients, we need to implement clickable buttons



This product is not %100 complete,there are minor bugs. But the main aspects, such as successfully 
establishing a connection between server and client does work, and etc.
